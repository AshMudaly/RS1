  By not providing "Findmoveit_commander.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "moveit_commander", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "moveit_commander"

    moveit_commanderConfig.cmake
    moveit_commander-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "moveit_commander" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "moveit_commander_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "moveit_commander" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
